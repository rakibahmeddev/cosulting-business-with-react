                  Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a
                  person or device. A common example is entering a username and
                  password when you log in to a website. Entering the correct
                  login information lets the website know 1) who you are and 2)
                  that it is actually you accessing the website

                  Authorization is the process of giving someone the ability to
                  access a resource. A good example is house ownership. The
                  owner has full access rights to the property (the resource)
                  but can grant other people the right to access it. You say
                  that the owner authorizes people to access it. This simple
                  example allows us to introduce a few concepts in the
                  authorization context.
